# Module-5-Challenge

In this challenge, I successfully completed most of the requirements with what I learned in the class and the provided hints in the starter file. However, I still encountered the following few troubles.

- In order to identify the duplicate mice and drop the data associated with the duplicate mice, I consulted ChatGPT and was able to apply the method provided and successfully cleaned the data eventually.

- In Quartiles and Outliers section, I had trouble with constructing the for loop to store each drug regimen's data separately. The Github link below was a good resource that helped me solved this problem I was having.

- In order to hightlight the outlier in the Boxplots section, I used ChatGPT to look up the syntax, which was "flierprops".

Resources that I referred to for completing this homework:
